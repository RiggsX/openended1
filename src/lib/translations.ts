          q: "Is this for beginners?",
          a: "Yes. The workflows are designed to be followed step-by-step, regardless of your AI experience. If you can copy and paste, you can use this system. That said, it's also valuable for experienced users who want more structure and consistency.",
        },
        {
          q: "Do I need any technical skills?",
          a: "No. You don't need to code, understand APIs, or configure anything. The workflows are written in plain language and designed to work with the AI tools you already use — ChatGPT, Claude, and similar interfaces.",
        },
        {
          q: "What AI tools does this work with?",
          a: "ChatGPT, Claude, and similar conversational AI models. The workflows are tool-agnostic — they focus on the process, not the specific platform. As long as you have access to a capable language model, the system works.",
        },
        {
          q: "Is this just a collection of prompts?",
          a: "No. Prompts are part of larger workflows. Each workflow is a multi-step process that tells you what to do, when to do it, and how to adapt based on results. Prompts are embedded in context — not standalone tricks you have to figure out how to use.",
        },
        {
          q: "Will this become outdated?",
          a: "That's the whole point of the subscription. New workflows are added every month, and existing ones get updated as AI evolves. You're not buying a static product — you're subscribing to a living system that stays current.",
        },
        {
          q: "How does the subscription work?",
          a: "Choose a plan (Core, Plus, or Pro), pay monthly or yearly, and get immediate access to your member dashboard. New workflows are delivered every month. You can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel anytime — no lock-in.",
        },
        {
          q: "What happens if I cancel?",
          a: "You keep access until the end of your billing period. After that, you lose access to the member dashboard and future updates. You can resubscribe anytime to pick up where you left off.",
        },
        {
          q: "Is there a free trial?",
          a: "We're working on it. For now, if the system doesn't work for you within the first 14 days, reach out and we'll make it right. No questions asked.",

          q: "Can I use this for my team?",
