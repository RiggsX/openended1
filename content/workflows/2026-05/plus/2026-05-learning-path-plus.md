## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Skill Definition & Goal Setting
**Trigger:** You want to learn a new skill

**Prompt:**
```
Define the skill you want to learn:

**Skill:** [What do you want to learn?]
Example: "Python programming", "Public speaking", "Data analysis", "Digital marketing"

**Why this skill?**
- Career goal: [How will this help your career?]
- Personal goal: [How will this enrich your life?]
- Timeline: [When do you need this skill?]

**Current Level:**
- [ ] Complete beginner (never done this)
- [ ] Novice (tried a little, very basic knowledge)
- [ ] Intermediate (some experience, can do basic tasks)
- [ ] Advanced (proficient, want to master)

**Target Level:**
- [ ] Functional (can do basic tasks independently)
- [ ] Proficient (can handle most situations confidently)
- [ ] Expert (can teach others, solve complex problems)

**Success Criteria:**
What does "learned" look like for you?
- [Specific outcome 1: e.g., "Build a working web app"]
- [Specific outcome 2: e.g., "Give a 20-min presentation confidently"]
- [Specific outcome 3: e.g., "Get hired for a role requiring this skill"]

**Time Commitment:**
- Hours per week: [Realistic estimate]

### Step 6: Overcoming Plateaus
**Prompt:**
```
When progress stalls, use these strategies:

## Plateau Diagnosis

**Symptom: Not understanding concepts**
- [ ] Go back to basics (review fundamentals)
- [ ] Try different resource (different teaching style)
- [ ] Explain it to someone (teaching reveals gaps)
- [ ] Draw diagrams (visualize the concept)
- [ ] Take a break (let it marinate)

**Symptom: Bored or unmotivated**
- [ ] Work on a fun project (apply skills creatively)
- [ ] Join a community (social motivation)
- [ ] Set a challenge (gamify your learning)
- [ ] Revisit your "why" (reconnect with purpose)
- [ ] Take a strategic break (avoid burnout)

**Symptom: Overwhelmed by complexity**
- [ ] Break it down smaller (micro-steps)
- [ ] Focus on one thing (don't multitask learning)
- [ ] Simplify your project (reduce scope)
- [ ] Get help (mentor, tutor, study group)
- [ ] Celebrate small wins (build confidence)

**Symptom: Not retaining information**
- [ ] Use spaced repetition (review regularly)
- [ ] Apply immediately (use it or lose it)
- [ ] Teach someone (best way to solidify)
- [ ] Create cheat sheets (summarize key points)
- [ ] Sleep well (memory consolidation happens during sleep)

**Symptom: Imposter syndrome**
- [ ] Remember: Everyone starts as a beginner
- [ ] Compare to past you (not to experts)
- [ ] Share your work (get real feedback)
- [ ] Celebrate progress (acknowledge how far you've come)
- [ ] Connect with other learners (you're not alone)
