## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Define Presentation Goals
**Trigger:** You need to create a presentation

**Prompt:**
```
Define your presentation goals:

**Presentation Type:**
- [ ] Sales pitch
- [ ] Conference talk
- [ ] Internal update
- [ ] Workshop/training
- [ ] Investor pitch
- [ ] Product demo
- [ ] Other: [Specify]

**Context:**
- **Audience:** [Who will be there? Size? Seniority?]
- **Duration:** [How long do you have?]
- **Format:** [In-person/Virtual/Hybrid]
- **Setting:** [Formal/Casual, Large room/Small room]
- **When:** [Date and time]

**Primary Goal:**
[What's the ONE thing you want them to do/think/feel after?]

**Success Metrics:**
- [How will you know if this worked?]
- [What action do you want them to take?]

**Audience Analysis:**
- **What they know:** [Current knowledge level]

```

**Decision Point:** If audience is mixed (different knowledge levels) → create modular content that can be adjusted on the fly.

### Step 2: Structure Your Story
**Prompt:**
```
Create presentation structure:

# Presentation Structure: [Title]

**Credibility:** [Why should they listen to you?]
[1 sentence establishing your authority]

**Preview:** [What will you cover?]
"Today I'll show you [X], explain [Y], and share [Z]"

---

## Body (75% of time)

**Structure Options:**

**Option A: Problem-Solution**
1. The Problem: [What's broken?]
2. Why It Matters: [Impact/consequences]
3. The Solution: [Your approach]
4. How It Works: [Details]
5. Proof: [Evidence it works]

**Option B: Three-Act Story**
1. Setup: [Current state]
2. Conflict: [Challenge/obstacle]
3. Resolution: [How you overcame it]

## Closing (15% of time)

**Summary:** [Recap key points in 30 seconds]

**Call to Action:** [What do you want them to do?]

## Key Moments to Rehearse

**Opening (First 2 minutes):**
- Memorize this word-for-word
- Practice until it feels natural
- This sets the tone for everything

**Transitions:**
- How you move between points
- Smooth transitions = professional delivery
- Practice: "Now that we've covered X, let's look at Y"

**Data/Charts:**
- Don't just read the chart
- Tell the story: "What you're seeing here is..."
- Point out the key insight

**Stories:**
- Practice emotional delivery
- Use pauses for effect
- Make eye contact during stories

**Closing:**
- Memorize your call to action
- End strong (don't trail off)
- Practice your final line

---

## Delivery Techniques

**Voice:**
- Vary pace (slow down for important points)
- Vary volume (louder for emphasis)
- Use pauses (silence is powerful)
- Avoid filler words ("um", "like", "you know")

**Body Language:**
- Stand tall (confident posture)
- Use hand gestures (natural, not forced)
- Move purposefully (don't pace nervously)
- Face the audience (not the screen)

**Eye Contact:**
- Scan the room (don't fixate on one person)
- Hold eye contact for 3-5 seconds per person
- Include all sections of the room

**Energy:**
- Start with high energy (sets the tone)
- Match energy to content (serious topics = serious tone)
- End with high energy (leave them energized)
