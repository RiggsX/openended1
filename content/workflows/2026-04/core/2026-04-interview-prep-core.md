### Step 2: Story Bank Creation

[Repeat STAR format]

---

**Story Categories to Cover:**

**Tips:**

- Be honest about challenges and failures
```

---

### Step 3: Common Question Preparation
**Prompt:**
```
Prepare answers to common interview questions:

[2-minute pitch: Current role → Relevant experience → Why this role]

**2. "Why do you want this role?"**
[Connect: Your goals + Their needs + Company mission]

**3. "What's your biggest strength?"**
[Strength + Story + How it applies to this role]

**4. "What's your biggest weakness?"**
[Real weakness + What you're doing to improve + Progress made]

**5. "Tell me about a time you failed"**
[Use Story Bank: Situation → What went wrong → What you learned → How you've applied that lesson]

**6. "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"**
[Growth trajectory that aligns with this role]

**7. "Why are you leaving your current job?"**
[Positive framing: What you're moving toward, not running from]

**8. "What are your salary expectations?"**
[Research market rate + Your range based on experience]

**9. "Do you have any questions for us?"**
[Use questions from Step 1 + Add 2-3 more based on conversation]

---

Practice saying these out loud. Record yourself if possible.
```

---

- They want you to succeed (they're investing time in you)
- It's OK to pause and think before answering
- You're also interviewing them (is this a good fit for YOU?)
- One interview doesn't define your worth

**If You Get Nervous:**
- Take a deep breath
- Remember: You were selected for a reason
- Focus on being curious, not perfect
- Worst case: It's practice for the next one

---

**Self-Reflection:**
- What went well?
- What could I improve for next time?
- Do I still want this job?
- What did I learn about my interview skills?

---

**Follow-Up Timeline:**
- If they said "we'll be in touch by [date]" → wait until that date + 2 days
- If no timeline given → follow up after 1 week
- If rejected → ask for feedback (most won't give it, but worth asking)
```
