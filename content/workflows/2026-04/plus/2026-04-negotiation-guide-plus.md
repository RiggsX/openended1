## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Situation Analysis
**Trigger:** You have an upcoming negotiation

**Prompt:**
```
Analyze the negotiation situation:

**Negotiation Type:**
- [ ] Salary/compensation
- [ ] Contract terms
- [ ] Business deal
- [ ] Partnership agreement
- [ ] Vendor/supplier pricing
- [ ] Other: [Specify]

**Context:**
- **What you want:** [Your desired outcome]
- **What they want:** [Their likely desired outcome]
- **Current offer/status:** [Where things stand now]
- **Deadline:** [When decision must be made]
- **Relationship:** [Ongoing/one-time, collaborative/adversarial]

**Stakeholders:**
- **Your side:** [Who's involved, who decides]
- **Their side:** [Who you're negotiating with, who has authority]
- **Decision maker:** [Who has final say on their side]

**BATNA (Best Alternative To Negotiated Agreement):**
- **Your BATNA:** [What you'll do if this falls through]
- **Their BATNA:** [What they'll do if this falls through]
- **Whose BATNA is stronger?** [Yours/Theirs/Equal]

**ZOPA (Zone of Possible Agreement):**
- **Your walk-away point:** [Minimum acceptable outcome]
- **Your target:** [Ideal outcome]
- **Their likely walk-away:** [Estimate]
- **Their likely target:** [Estimate]
- **Is there overlap?** [Yes/No/Uncertain]
```

**Decision Point:** If your BATNA is weak and their BATNA is strong → focus on improving your BATNA before negotiating.

### Step 2: Leverage Analysis
**Prompt:**
```
Identify your leverage points:

## Your Strengths (What gives you power)
1. [Strength 1]
   - Evidence: [Why this matters]
   - How to use: [When to bring this up]

2. [Strength 2]
   - Evidence: [Why this matters]
   - How to use: [When to bring this up]

3. [Strength 3]
   - Evidence: [Why this matters]
   - How to use: [When to bring this up]

## Your Weaknesses (What limits your power)
1. [Weakness 1]
   - Impact: [How this hurts you]
   - Mitigation: [How to minimize]

2. [Weakness 2]
   - Impact: [How this hurts you]
   - Mitigation: [How to minimize]

## Their Strengths (What gives them power)
1. [Their strength 1]
   - How to counter: [Your response]

2. [Their strength 2]
   - How to counter: [Your response]

## Their Weaknesses (What limits their power)
1. [Their weakness 1]
   - How to exploit: [Tactfully]

2. [Their weakness 2]
   - How to exploit: [Tactfully]

## Power Balance
**Overall leverage:** [You have more/Equal/They have more]
**Confidence level:** [1-10]
```

---

### Step 3: Strategy Development
**Prompt:**
```
Develop your negotiation strategy:

## Opening Position
**Your first offer:** [Specific number/terms]
**Rationale:** [Why this is justified]
**Anchoring strategy:** [Go first or let them go first?]

**If you anchor first:**
- Advantage: Set the frame
- Risk: Might leave money on the table
- Tactic: Start high but reasonable

**If they anchor first:**
- Advantage: Learn their range
- Risk: Their anchor might influence you
- Tactic: Don't react immediately, counter with your research

## Concession Strategy
**What you're willing to concede:**
1. [Concession 1] - Value to you: [Low/Medium/High]
2. [Concession 2] - Value to you: [Low/Medium/High]
3. [Concession 3] - Value to you: [Low/Medium/High]

**What you want in return:**
1. [Ask 1] - Value to them: [Low/Medium/High]
2. [Ask 2] - Value to them: [Low/Medium/High]
3. [Ask 3] - Value to them: [Low/Medium/High]

**Concession Rules:**
- Never concede without getting something back
- Make concessions smaller each time (signals you're near your limit)
- Concede on low-value items to get high-value items
- Don't concede too quickly (makes them think there's more to get)

## Negotiation Tactics to Use

**Tactic 1: The Flinch**
When they make an offer, show surprise: "Is that the best you can do?"
Use when: Their first offer is weak

**Tactic 2: The Silence**
After making your ask, stay silent. Let them fill the void.
Use when: You've stated your position clearly

**Tactic 3: The Trade**
"I can do X if you can do Y"
Use when: Creating win-win solutions

**Tactic 4: The Higher Authority**
"I need to check with [boss/partner/board]"
Use when: You need time or want to avoid pressure

**Tactic 5: The Deadline**
"I need to decide by [date]"
Use when: Creating urgency (but only if true)

**Tactics to Avoid:**
- Lying (destroys trust)
- Ultimatums (unless you mean it)
- Personal attacks (keep it professional)
- Showing desperation (weakens position)

## Communication Strategy
**Tone:** [Collaborative/Assertive/Formal/Casual]
**Framing:** [How you'll position your asks]
**Emotion management:** [How you'll stay calm]
```

### Step 4: Preparation & Practice
**Prompt:**
```
Prepare for the negotiation:

## Research Checklist
- [ ] Market rates/benchmarks (for salary/pricing negotiations)
- [ ] Their recent deals/hires (what have they paid before?)
- [ ] Industry standards (what's typical?)
- [ ] Their financial situation (can they afford your ask?)
- [ ] Your alternatives (strengthen your BATNA)

## Script Your Key Moments

**Opening:**
"Thanks for meeting. I'm excited about [opportunity]. I've done some research and have some thoughts on [topic]."

**Making your ask:**
"Based on [research/market rates/value I bring], I'm looking for [specific ask]. Here's why that's fair: [rationale]."

**Handling objections:**
- Objection: "That's too high"
  → Response: "I understand. Let me explain how I arrived at this number: [breakdown]"

- Objection: "We can't do that"
  → Response: "What can you do? Let's find a solution that works for both of us."

- Objection: "You need to decide now"
  → Response: "I appreciate the urgency, but I need [time] to consider this properly."

**Closing:**
"So if I understand correctly, we're agreeing to [terms]. Is that right?"

## Role-Play Practice
**Play both sides:**
1. You make your ask → They push back → You respond
2. They make an offer → You counter → They respond
3. You're stuck → You propose creative solution → They react

**Practice with a friend:**
- Have them play hardball
- Practice staying calm under pressure
- Get feedback on your tone and body language

## Materials to Prepare
- [ ] Research document (market data, benchmarks)
- [ ] Your value proposition (why you're worth it)
- [ ] Alternative options (your BATNA)
- [ ] Questions to ask them
- [ ] Concession matrix (what you'll trade)
```

---

### Step 5: During the Negotiation
**Prompt:**
```
Execution checklist:

## Before You Start
- [ ] Review your target and walk-away point
- [ ] Take 3 deep breaths
- [ ] Remind yourself: This is a conversation, not a battle
- [ ] Set your intention: Aim for win-win

## During the Conversation

**Listen More Than You Talk:**
- Let them explain their position
- Ask clarifying questions
- Take notes
- Look for hidden interests (what do they really want?)

**Use These Phrases:**
- "Help me understand..." (to gather information)
- "What if we..." (to propose creative solutions)
- "I can do X if you can do Y" (to trade)
- "Let me think about that" (to buy time)
- "Is there any flexibility on..." (to test limits)

**Watch for These Signals:**

**They're close to yes:**
- Asking detailed questions about next steps
- Discussing implementation
- Softening language ("maybe we could...")
- Checking with others

**They're not budging:**
- Repeating the same position
- Using absolute language ("we can't", "it's impossible")
- Getting defensive
- Threatening to walk away

**Red Flags (consider walking away):**
- They're lying or being deceptive
- They're disrespectful or abusive
- Terms are getting worse, not better
- Your gut says something's wrong

## Managing Emotions

**If you feel angry:**
- Take a break ("Can we pause for 5 minutes?")
- Breathe deeply
- Remember your goal (don't let ego take over)

**If you feel pressured:**
- Slow down ("I need time to think")
- Ask questions (shifts pressure back to them)
- Remember your BATNA (you have options)

**If you feel excited:**
- Don't show it (they'll know they can push harder)
- Stay measured
- Don't agree too quickly

## Taking Notes
Write down:
- Their offers and terms
- Their reasoning
- Any commitments they make
- Questions you still have
- Your gut reactions
```

---

### Step 6: Closing & Follow-Up
**Prompt:**
```
Close the negotiation properly:

## Before You Agree

**Final Check:**
- [ ] Does this meet your minimum requirements?
- [ ] Have you gotten something for every concession?
- [ ] Are all terms clear and specific?
- [ ] Is this better than your BATNA?
- [ ] Do you feel good about this? (gut check)

**If yes to all → Proceed to close**
**If no to any → Keep negotiating or walk away**

## Closing the Deal

**Verbal Agreement:**
"Let me make sure I understand what we're agreeing to:
- [Term 1]
- [Term 2]
- [Term 3]
Is that correct?"

**Get it in Writing:**
"Great! Can you send me a written summary of what we've agreed to?"

**Timeline:**
"When can I expect the [contract/offer letter/agreement]?"

**Next Steps:**
"What happens next? Who do I follow up with?"

## Follow-Up Email (Same Day)

Subject: Summary of our conversation - [Topic]

Hi [Name],

---

**If They Need Time:**
"I understand you need to think about it. When can I expect to hear back?"
[Set a specific date, don't leave it open-ended]

**If You Need Time:**
"This is a big decision. I need [timeframe] to consider it. Can we reconnect on [specific date]?"

**If You're Walking Away:**
"I appreciate your time, but this doesn't work for me. If circumstances change, feel free to reach out."
[Stay professional, don't burn bridges]
```

### Step 7: Post-Negotiation Analysis
**Prompt:**
```
